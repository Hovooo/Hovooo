My latest public projects, I've developed as solo author of smart contracts, deployment scripts, fuzz & invariant tests:

- [jigsaw-finsnce/jigsaw-lite](https://github.com/jigsaw-finance/jigsaw-lite) - Lite version of the CDP-lending ptotocol
- [jigsaw-finance/jigsaw-protocol-v1](https://github.com/jigsaw-finance/jigsaw-protocol-v1) - The revolutionary CDP-lending ptotocol that allows unique collateral flexibility
- [jigsaw-finance/jigsaw-strategies-v1](https://github.com/jigsaw-finance/jigsaw-strategies-v1) - Intermediary smart contracts to wrap various third-party protocols (aave, pendle, dinero, etc) into unified interface to allow users of the CDP-lending ptotocol to invest their collateral into those protovols
